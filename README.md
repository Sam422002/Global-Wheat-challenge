# Global-Wheat-challenge
An object detection solution for the Global Wheat Detection challenge. This project identifies wheat heads in diverse outdoor field images to assist in crop density estimation. The model handles environmental challenges like wind blur and plant overlap, generalizing across varying global growing conditions to support precision agriculture.
